This should be done to all existing student loans as well as new ones going forward.

This would free up money that would flow back into the economy in consumer buying, including things like first time home-buying.

Wall Street banks are getting those low rates to help them recover from the consequences of their own irresponsible and fraudulent behavior that crashed America's and the world's economy.

The only crime of most college students and graduates is wanting an education and a middle class standard of living.

We deserve at least as good a deal as big banks are getting.",

The student is frustrated by her alleged disinterest in the success of her students. Specifically, he criticizes her decision to simply give printed handouts to her students instead of actively engaging and teaching them. 
Instead of responding to or defending herself against these accusations, she simply tells the student to leave the room, showing that she does not care about her students or the quality of their education. 

Ms. Phung should be removed from her position at DHS immediately. ",

Jones received many honors during his long career, from Most Promising New Country Vocalist in 1956, being inducted into the Country Nusic Hall of Fame in 1992.

We would encourage the Obama Administration to pay for this increased spending by cutting spending elsewhere in the budget to ensure this idea would be deficit/debt neutral.

We support making post-secondary education more affordable because lower costs will increase accessibility and equalize opportunity.   A more educated society benefits the country in many ways, most importantly, by increasing economic opportunity and promoting economic growth.

Thank you for your support.

The government has already condoned the spiritual use of psychedelics by select religious organizations on the conditions that the substances are strictly controlled and safely consumed. This is a freedom that should be entrusted to all individuals.

A license would require an individual to pass a written test, an age requirement, and a psychoanalysis. Once licensed, he/she would be permitted to consume and purchase psychedelics through a regulated distribution process.

Here, \"Psychedelics\" is defined as the following compounds: 
Tetrahydrocannabinols, LSD, DMT, MDMA, MDA, Mescaline, Psilocybin, and Psilocin.",
